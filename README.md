### Hi fellow human 👋

Glad you found your way here :) 

🔭 You'll currently find me building MLOps and distributed computing tools at @bioserenity.com using Python 🐍. 

⚡ I absolutely love low-level programming and EE. As well as reading.

📖 Favorite books:
* Introduction to algorithms - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein - MIT press
* Computer systems : A Programmer’s perspective - Bryant R. - Pearson
* Operating systems : Three easy pieces - Arpaci-Dusseau A. R
* Engineering a Compiler - Cooper, Keith D., Torczon, Linda - Elsevier

🔭 In my free time, I work on `Columnar`, a column-oriented database engine, featuring an ANSI SQL parser and high aggregation performances.
