### Hi fellow human ðŸ‘‹

Glad you found your way here :) 

ðŸ”­ You'll currently find me building MLOps and distributed computing tools at @bioserenity.com. 

ðŸŒ± When I find time, I contribute to open source, mostly personnal projects, you'll find stuff I helped build as my pinned repositories.

âš¡ Deep down what I love is low-level/system programming. Though I never had the chance to profesionnally work with it.

I also do some competitive programming : 
* Leetcode account : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/olivierkessler/)

And try and do sec/capture the flag:
* CTF account : [HackThe Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1637881)
