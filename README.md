### Hi fellow human ðŸ‘‹

Glad you found your way here :) 

ðŸ”­ You'll currently find me building MLOps and distributed computing tools at @bioserenity.com. 

ðŸŒ± When I find time, I contribute to open source, mostly personnal projects, you'll find stuff I helped build as my pinned repositories.

âš¡ Deep down I love is low-level/system programming. Though I never had the chance to profesionnally work with it.


ðŸ“– Books I've been studying on my free time for the last 3 years:
* Introduction to algorithms - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein - MIT press
* Computer systems : A Programmerâ€™s perspective - Bryant R. - Pearson
* Operating systems : Three easy pieces - Arpaci-Dusseau A. R
* Designing data-intensive applications - Kleppmann M. - Oâ€™Reilly
* System Design Interview - Wu A. - ByteByteGo
